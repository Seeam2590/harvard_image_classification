# A Beginner's Image Recognition Challenge

## Introduction:
I use different type of self-built models (CNNs and ResNets) and pre-trained models  like VGG19 and ResNet50 to classify 4 different locations at Harvard College.

## Objectives: 

1. Model can classify Harvard location with over 90% accuracy
2. First end-to-end experience in learning about and being able to create advanced image classification models using modern tools like Tensorflow, Jupyter Hub etc. and also using pre-trained state of the art models like VGG16 and ResNet50.
3. Make project publicly accessible with strong documentation
